================================================================================
01. PROPER WEARING METHOD (Page 5)
================================================================================

Key Instructions:

1. WAIST BELT POSITION
   - Wear the waist belt above your pelvis and tighten it as much as possible.

2. SHOULDER STRAP ADJUSTMENT
   - Adjust the shoulder straps according to your baby's growth.

3. SIDE STRAP ADJUSTMENT
   - Tighten the side straps for better weight distribution, making it more 
     comfortable for your shoulders and waist.

4. LEG BUCKLE (OUTWARD FACING)
   - Release the leg buckle when carrying baby facing outward.

[!] IMPORTANT TIP
    - Facing inward: Adjust the (Lumi-Lock) buckle according to baby's growth.
    - Facing outward: Release the (Lumi-Lock) leg buckle.
    - Tightening all straps distributes weight evenly for comfortable extended wear.


================================================================================
02. CHECKLIST WHEN CARRYING BABY (Page 6)
================================================================================

CHECK THESE 3 THINGS!

1. Hold the zipper with one hand and the top of the zipper with the other hand 
   to align them properly.

2. Leave about a hand span from the bottom of the zipper - it will go up easily.

3. DOUBLE-LOCK ZIPPER - Auto-locks when pulled up, press again for double lock!

[!] SAFETY CHECK
    After picking up your baby, always make sure the zipper is completely closed. 
    Activate the double lock to ensure safety.


================================================================================
03. BREASTFEEDING & BACK ZIPPER USAGE (Page 7)
================================================================================

FOR BREASTFEEDING
-----------------
Lower the (Stay-Lock) zipper for comfortable breastfeeding.

BACK ZIPPER USAGE
-----------------
Use the back zipper when laying baby down, putting on/taking off the carrier, 
or when carrying on back.

[!] CONVENIENT FEATURE
    Using the Stay-Lock zipper allows comfortable breastfeeding without removing 
    the carrier. The back zipper makes putting on and taking off the carrier easier.

    legs and fasten
